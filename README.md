# Demo repository for Computing Club ECS p5js tutorial

Tutorial given F2025 to Computing Club to support the Fall Game Jam.  Intention of the tutorial is to demonstrate (1) how to use p5js to write a game from scratch and (2) show how the ECS design pattern works.

The main branch of this repo includes the final **working** state of the demo and each branch is the **working** stage for its respective part in the tutorial.

While this repo also is setup to [host the games in a working state](https://efredericks.github.io/p5-ecs-demo/), the p5js online demo can be found here: [https://editor.p5js.org/frederer/sketches/saybmOwu4](https://editor.p5js.org/frederer/sketches/saybmOwu4).
